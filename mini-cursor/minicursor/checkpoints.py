"""File-level checkpoints for /undo.

Before `write_file`/`edit_file` mutate a path, the agent records that path's
pre-turn content here. When the turn ends, everything recorded during it is
persisted as one checkpoint (a JSON file under `~/.minicursor/checkpoints/`,
keyed by a hash of the workspace path so unrelated projects don't collide).
`/undo` pops the most recent checkpoint and restores every file it touched to
its pre-turn state (or deletes it, if the file didn't exist before the turn).

Scope, on purpose: this only covers `write_file`/`edit_file`, the two tools
mini-cursor fully controls and already diffs before applying. `run_command`
can do anything (install packages, mutate unrelated state, talk to a
network) — there is no honest way to snapshot and revert that generically, so
it isn't covered. Checkpoints are a safety net for agent-authored file edits,
not a full VM undo.
